# Visualize
- Interactive visualizations using D3, JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
- Explored total CO2 emissions as well as CO2 emissions per capita across the globe.
- Created map chart of the world, pie chart and bar graph to visualize the emissions.
- Data of 1990 and 1991 was not available for some countries, hence they are shown in grey color.
- Clicking on a country in the map chart will plot bar graph of the selected country.
- Colors of the Pie chart are based on the continents.
- A tooltip is added to give precise number of emissions of the corresponding country.
